### Learning via knowledge graph and reddit journal clubs
It is a natural idea to look for ways to learn things like going through a skill tree in a computer RPG.

For example I made a [DAG for juggling](https://ypei.me/posts/2015-04-02-juggling-skill-tree.html).

Websites like [Knowen](https://knowen.org) and [Metacademy](https://metacademy.org) explore this idea with added flavour of open collaboration.

The design of Metacademy looks quite promising. It also has a nice tagline: "your package manager for knowledge".

There are so so many tools to assist learning / research / knowledge sharing today, and we should keep experimenting, in the hope that eventually one of them will scale.

On another note, I often complain about the lack of a place to discuss math research online, but today I found on Reddit some journal clubs on machine learning: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/8aluhs/d_machine_learning_wayr_what_are_you_reading_week/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/8elmd8/d_anyone_having_trouble_reading_a_particular/). If only we had this for maths. On the other hand r/math does have some interesting recurring threads as well: [Everything about X](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/wiki/everythingaboutx) and [What Are You Working On?](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/search?q=what+are+you+working+on?+author:automoderator+&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all). Hopefully these threads can last for years to come.
