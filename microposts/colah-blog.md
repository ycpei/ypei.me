[colah's blog](https://colah.github.io/) has a cool feature that allows you to comment on any paragraph. Here's an [example](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/). If it is doable on a static site hosted on Github pages, I suppose it shouldn't be too hard to implement. This also seem to work more seamlessly than [Fermat's Library](https://fermatslibrary.com/), because the latter has to embed pdfs in webpages. Now fantasy time: imagine that one day arXiv shows html versions of papers (through author uploading or conversion from TeX) with this feature.
