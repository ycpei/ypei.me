Primer Science is a tool by a startup called Primer that uses NLP to summarize contents (but not single papers, yet) on arxiv. A developer of this tool predicts in [an interview](https://twimlai.com/twiml-talk-136-taming-arxiv-w-natural-language-processing-with-john-bohannon/#) that progress on AI's ability to extract meanings from AI research papers will be the biggest accelerant on AI research.
