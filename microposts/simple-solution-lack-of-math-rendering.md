The lack of maths rendering in major online communication platforms like instant messaging or emails or github have been a minor obsession of mine for quite a while, as I saw it as a big factor preventing people from talking more maths online, but today I realised  this is totally a non-issue. Just do what people on IRC have been doing since the inception of the universe: use a (latex) pastebin.
