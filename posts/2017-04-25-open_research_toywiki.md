As an experimental project, I am launching toywiki.

It hosts a collection of my research notes.

It takes some ideas from the open source culture and apply them to mathematical research:
1. It uses a very permissive license (CC-BY-SA). For example anyone can fork the project and make their own version if they have a different vision and want to build upon the project.
2. All edits will done with maximum transparency, and discussions of any of notes should also be as public as possible (e.g. Github issues)
3. Anyone can suggest changes by opening issues and submitting pull requests

Here are the links: [toywiki](http://toywiki.xyz) and [github repo](https://github.com/ycpei/toywiki).

Feedbacks are welcome by email.
