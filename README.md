This repository hosts all that is necessary to build [my personal webpage](https://ypei.me).

It roughly consists of two parts, the web content and the code. The web content are in the markdown files, and the code corresponds to the python, css, and the html template files.

The python code (`engine/engine.py`) is a tiny static site generator depending on [pypandoc](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypandoc), [PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org/) and [pyatom](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyatom).

The content is licensed under CC-BY-ND unless otherwise specified, and the code is licensed under GPLv3+.
