This repository hosts all that is necessary to build [my personal webpage](https://ypei.me).

It roughly consists of two parts, the contents and the code. The contents are the markdown files `*.md`, and the code are the python code, css code and templates.

The python code (`engine/engine.py`) is a tiny static site generator depending on [pypandoc](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypandoc), [PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org/) and [pyatom](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyatom).

The contents are licensed under CC-BY-ND unless otherwise specified.
The code is licensed under GPLv3+.
