                <p>Posted on 2015-07-01</p>
                    <p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04294">this paper</a> with <a href="http://homepages.lboro.ac.uk/~marh3/">Robin</a> we study the family of causal double product integrals \[ \prod_{a &lt; x &lt; y &lt; b}\left(1 + i{\lambda \over 2}(dP_x dQ_y - dQ_x dP_y) + i {\mu \over 2}(dP_x dP_y + dQ_x dQ_y)\right) \]</p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> are the mutually noncommuting momentum and position Brownian motions of quantum stochastic calculus. The evaluation is motivated heuristically by approximating the continuous double product by a discrete product in which infinitesimals are replaced by finite increments. The latter is in turn approximated by the second quantisation of a discrete double product of rotation-like operators in different planes due to a result in <a href="http://www.actaphys.uj.edu.pl/findarticle?series=Reg&amp;vol=46&amp;page=1851">(Hudson-Pei2015)</a>. The main problem solved in this paper is the explicit evaluation of the continuum limit <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> of the latter, and showing that <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is a unitary operator. The kernel of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is written in terms of Bessel functions, and the evaluation is achieved by working on a lattice path model and enumerating linear extensions of related partial orderings, where the enumeration turns out to be heavily related to Dyck paths and generalisations of Catalan numbers.</p>
