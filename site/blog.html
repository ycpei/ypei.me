    <p>Posted on 2018-06-03</p>
        <p>This post is meant as a documentation of my understanding of autodiff. I benefited a lot from <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/%7Ergrosse/courses/csc321_2018/slides/lec10.pdf">Toronto CSC321 slides</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/mattjj/autodidact/">autodidact</a> project which is a pedagogical implementation of <a href="https://github.com/hips/autograd">Autograd</a>. That said, any mistakes in this note are mine (especially since some of the knowledge is obtained from interpreting slides!), and if you do spot any I would be grateful if you can let me know.</p>

    <p>Posted on 2018-04-29</p>
        <p>It has been 9 months since I last wrote about open (maths) research. Since then two things happened which prompted me to write an update.</p>

    <p>Posted on 2017-08-07</p>
        <p>In this essay I describe some problems in academia of mathematics and propose an open source model, which I call open research in mathematics.</p>

    <p>Posted on 2016-10-13</p>
        <p>(Latest update: 2017-01-12) In <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00666">Matveev-Petrov 2016</a> a \(q\)-deformed Robinson-Schensted-Knuth algorithm (\(q\)RSK) was introduced. In this article we give reformulations of this algorithm in terms of Noumi-Yamada description, growth diagrams and local moves. We show that the algorithm is symmetric, namely the output tableaux pair are swapped in a sense of distribution when the input matrix is transposed. We also formulate a \(q\)-polymer model based on the \(q\)RSK and prove the corresponding Burke property, which we use to show a strong law of large numbers for the partition function given stationary boundary conditions and \(q\)-geometric weights. We use the \(q\)-local moves to define a generalisation of the \(q\)RSK taking a Young diagram-shape of array as the input. We write down the joint distribution of partition functions in the space-like direction of the \(q\)-polymer in \(q\)-geometric environment, formulate a \(q\)-version of the multilayer polynuclear growth model (\(q\)PNG) and write down the joint distribution of the \(q\)-polymer partition functions at a fixed time.</p>
